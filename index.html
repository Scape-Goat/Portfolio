             My name is Kyle Aksamit. I am currently a senior at Warren Central High School. I am the head programmer for the robotics team at Warren.
             I have also taken the AP Computer Programming class at Warren and have taught myself many programming languages.

       <P>
            One of my main skills is programming. I have learned multiple programming languages over the course of four years and I can easily switch between languages
            without being confused or having to look up the documentation for the language. Another skill of mine is building. I have been building and tinkering since I
            was five and can design and reverse engineer almost any object that is given to me. One of my most prominent skills is crying. I am capable of crying non-stop
            for twenty four hours straight without stopping. My tears also have a unique property that melts anything that they touch.

            The activity that I spend most of my time doing is robotics. Being the head programmer for the robotics team is very demanding as I have to show up to every meeting
            as well as come in when others may not have to. During this time I design all of the code for our robot to function. This includes the button map for the controlers
            we use as well as the code that enables the robot to compelete a task on its own with out a human touching anything. Most of this time is spent trouble shooting the 
            code to make sure that it will work correctly. Other than programming for my robotics team, the other activity that takes up most of my time is helping elementary 
            schools in warren with their robotics team and teaching the children at those schools programming.

            Click <a href = "https://www.Github.com/scape-goat"   target = "_blank">here</a> to go to my Github account. On my Github account, there are many projects on their that I have completed as a part of my AP Computer
            Science class. Many of these projects work however, there are some projects that are a work in progress or were specifically used to test some ideas I had come up with.
